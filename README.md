# synthwave chimes

showcase project for [School for Poetic Computation's The Musical Web](https://sfpc.study/sessions/summer-24/musical-web) class,
Summer 2024

**Description:**

A p5.js-crafted digital synth chime seamlessly blends visuals and sound. Floating shapes and dynamic strings respond to mouse interactions, generating electronic tones. The responsive design features a bar-like hook, a random pastel color palette, and fluid string connections. A real-time waveform display visualizes the audio output, offering an engaging audiovisual experience for desktop users, with mobile support coming soon.

**Note!**

If the sound isn't playing immediately it might be due to how web audio permissions work in browsers. Browsers typically require user interaction (like a click) before they allow audio to play. To ensure the sound plays, please click shapes to proceed. :)
