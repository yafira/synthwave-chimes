A p5.js-crafted digital chime synth merges visuals and sound. Floating shapes and dynamic strings respond to mouse interactions, triggering electronic tones. The responsive design features a bar-like hook, random pastel color palette, seamless string connections, a real-time waveform display visualizing the audio output, creating an engaging audiovisual experience for desktop users, with mobile support coming soon.
