**description:**

A p5.js-crafted digital chime synth seamlessly blends visuals and sound. Floating shapes and dynamic strings respond to mouse interactions, generating electronic tones. The responsive design features a bar-like hook, a random pastel color palette, and fluid string connections. A real-time waveform display visualizes the audio output, offering an engaging audiovisual experience for desktop users, with mobile support coming soon.
